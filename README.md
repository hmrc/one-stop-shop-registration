This is the repository for One Stop Shop Registration Backend

Frontend: https://github.com/hmrc/one-stop-shop-registration-frontend

Stub: https://github.com/hmrc/one-stop-shop-registration-stub

Requirements
------------

This service is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Play](http://playframework.com/), so needs at least a [JRE] to run.

## Run the application

To update from Nexus and start all services from the RELEASE version instead of snapshot
```
sm --start ONE_STOP_SHOP_ALL -r
```

### To run the application locally execute the following:
```
sm --stop ONE_STOP_SHOP_REGISTRATION
```
and 
```
sbt 'run 10201'
```

### Running correct version of mongo
We have introduced a transaction to the call to be able to ensure that both the vatreturn and correction get submitted to mongo.
Your local mongo is unlikely to be running a latest enough version and probably not in a replica set.
To do this, you'll need to stop your current mongo instance (docker ps to get the name of your mongo docker then docker stop <name> to stop)
Run at least 4.0 with a replica set:
```  
docker run --restart unless-stopped -d -p 27017-27019:27017-27019 --name mongo4 mongo:4.0 --replSet rs0
```
Connect to said replica set:
```
docker exec -it mongo4 mongo
```
When that console is there:
```
rs.initiate()
```
You then should be running 4.0 with a replica set. You may have to re-run the rs.initiate() after you've restarted

Unit and Integration Tests
------------

To run the unit and integration tests, you will need to open an sbt session on the browser.

### Unit Tests

To run all tests, run the following command in your sbt session:
```
test
```

To run a single test, run the following command in your sbt session:
```
testOnly <package>.<SpecName>
```

An asterisk can be used as a wildcard character without having to enter the package, as per the example below:
```
testOnly *RegistrationControllerSpec
```

### Integration Tests

To run all tests, run the following command in your sbt session:
```
it:test
```

To run a single test, run the following command in your sbt session:
```
it:testOnly <package>.<SpecName>
```

An asterisk can be used as a wildcard character without having to enter the package, as per the example below:
